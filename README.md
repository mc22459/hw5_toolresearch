================
My kitchen is fairly isolated from the rest of my house. As I am a large human--and need lots of food--I often find myself in it. Sometimes my phone dies and ill have to charge it in a slightly inconvenient way on my spice rack. In comes 3d-printing to the rescue. We have talked at length in this class about the debated usefullness of 3d-printed objects, I decided to test that quesiton for myself by joining countless others in making a 3d-printed iphone wall dock. I thought, not only will my phone be connveniently displayed, but ill have a nifty conversation piece while I cook a fancy ramen meal for friends. The dock, unfortunately, did not live up to expectations. First off, it took three tries to print correctly. Then, once printed, the support material was so fundamentally connected to the piece that when trying to remove it, the piece broke. I hot glued the bottom dock back to the larger, flat back rest, and finally tried it out. The application ended up being worse than the creation process (shame on you thingiverse designer). The entire thing was very flimsy. I had to be careful each time I put my phone on to make sure that the printed piece wouldnt fall off the charger itself. The connections seem as if they would function better if printed on an SLS printer as many of the parts have a lot of overhang, or are small. Overall, I will not be using this design in the future, and will return to placing my phone atop the spices.
