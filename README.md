My kitchen is fairly isolated from the rest of my house. As I am a large human--and need lots of food--I often find myself in it.Often, my phone will die and ill have to charge it in a slightly inconvenient way on my spice rack. In comes 3d-printing to 
the rescue. We have talked at length in this class about the usefullness of 3d-printed objects, I decided to test that quesiton 
for myself by joining countless others in making a 3d-printed iphone wall dock. I thought, not only will my phone be connveniently displayed, but ill be able to have a nifty conversation piece while I cook a fancy ramen meal for friends. The dock, unfornately, did not live up to expectations. First off, it took three tries to print correctly. Then, once printed, the support material was so fundamentally connected to the piece that when trying to remove it, the piece broke. I hot glued the bottom dock back to the larger, flat back rest, and finally tried it out.
